#Let's take a look at the Golden State Warriors in the third quarter (first 21 games of 2017-18)

_How good are they?_ **SPOILER ALERT** _Very_ 

**TL; DR, I just want to meme**

In the third quarter, Steph Curry comes in and goes ham. In the third quarter, he leads the team in points, fouls drawn, steals, assists, and minutes. The Warriors score on average 2.9 more points in the third with an average increase of 4.7\% in FG\%, up to 55.4\%, an average increase of 7\% in FG\%, up to 46.8\%. Their plus-minus in the third is over 6.
